  <p>The Autofirma app allows advanced electronic signatures on local files to be made easily.</p>
  <p>To simplify the process for the user, the signature format to use is automatically determined based on the selected data file. The user can modify the default signature format for each file type from the preferences menu.</p>
  <p>All CAdES, XAdES and PAdES-BES signatures generated by &quot;Autofirma&quot; are performed according to the Baseline profiles. Not so, the Basic PAdES signatures.</p>
  <p>Autofirma is designed to use electronic DNI (DNIe) as a preferred device for creating signatures on systems with smart card reader installed, although you can make use of any other certificate installed in the OS. Autofirma supports DNIe 2.0 and DNIe 3.0 via contacts chip and NFC. When a DNIe is used, the signature certificate is automatically selected.</p>
  <p>The use of Autofirma is very simple, with only three screens on your user interface:<ul>
    <li><a href="pgs/PantallaEspera.html"> Waiting screen for DNIe insertion </a> (appears only when smart card readers are detected).</li>
    <li><a href="pgs/PantallaFirma.html"> File signature screen. </a></li>
    <li><a href="pgs/PantallaDetalle.html"> Signature result screen. </a></li>
   </ul>
   <p>You can access this support window at any time by pressing the <code> F1 </code> key ( <code> arrow+? </code> in macOS).</p>
   
   <h2>Adaptation to the National Security Scheme</h2>
   <p>The products of Autofirma may contain among the algorithms available, some not recommended by the National Security Scheme Guide 807 (ENS; edited by the National Crypto Center, CCN) in force at the time of publication of this document. Therefore, it remains the responsibility of the applications that make use of these products to properly configure the calls to them to generate the expected result, valid and appropriate for that moment and the desired level of safety, using algorithms of the SHA-2 family as specified in this standard for the generation of electronic signatures.</p>
   <p>You can check the current standard from the following link:https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/series-ccn-stic/800-guia-esquema-nacional-de-seguridad/513-ccn-stic-807-criptologia-de-empleo-en-el-ens/file.html</p>
