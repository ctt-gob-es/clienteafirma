  <h2>White Domain List Settings</h2>
  <p>Sometimes, Java does not recognize some domains as safe when connecting with Autofirma to an external service via an SSL channel. This feature allows you to set up a list of domains that will be recognized as safe and avoid this problem.</p>
  <p>These domains may be added to the text box shown in the image below, commas separator or line jumps. It is also permitted to be marked with an asterisk as a wildcard at the beginning or end of the domain indicated.</p>

  <p>The set settings will apply when you press the <b> OK button. </b> If the <b> Cancel button is pressed, </b> the window will be closed without applying the settings.</p>
