  <h2>Properties of visible signatures PDF</h2>
  <p>By enabling the creation of visible signatures PDF, the user will be given the possibility to select a signature area on the PDF to be signed in PAdES format.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../gfx/menufirmaspadesvisible1_mini.png" alt="Signature position selection window"></p>
  <p>This menu allows you to use the mouse to select a rectangular area from one of the pages of the PDF.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><b> X: </b> Number of pixels on the X axis at the beginning of the signature area.</li>
  	<li><b> And: </b> Number of pixels on the Y axis at the beginning of the signature area.</li>
  	<li><b> Width: </b> Number of pixels that extends horizontally to the signature area.</li>
  	<li><b> Height: </b> Number of pixels vertically extending the signature area.</li>
  	<li><b> (Preview of PDF page): </b> The user must click and drag the mouse over this area to select the visible signature area. The positions and the size of the signature area are expressed in pixels with respect to the scale on which the image of the page is shown.</li>
  	<li><b> &lt;&lt;: </b> Button to move the display to the first page of the PDF.</li>
  	<li><b> &lt;: </b> Button to move the display to the front page of the PDF. You can reproduce this behavior by pressing the left cursor key on your keyboard.</li>
  	<li><b> >: </b> Button to move the display to the next page of the PDF. You can reproduce this behavior by pressing the &quot;right cursor&quot; key on your keyboard. If we are on the last page of the PDF this option will allow us to create a blank page at the end of the document in which the signature can be inserted.</li>
  	<li><b> >>: </b> Button to move the display to the last page of the PDF.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this same window, at the bottom, it is allowed to indicate the page or pages where the visible signature must appear. The options are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><b> Current page: </b> The visible signature will appear on the page selected in the top position selector.</li>
  	<li>All <b> pages: </b> The visible signature will appear on all pages of the document.</li>
  	<li><b> Page selection: </b> This option allows you to select the page or page range where the visible signature will appear. If you want to indicate a page or several pages where the visible signature is displayed, you can indicate page by page with a comma separation (1,4.7: <code> </code> It is stamped on pages 1, 4 and 7 or indicating a range of pages through a script (1-8: <code> </code> It is printed on the pages from 1 to 8). It is also possible to indicate the pages according to their position since the end of the document. For this, the position with a negative value (-2: <code> </code> Stamp the signature on the penultimate page). These mechanisms can be combined. For example:<ul>
  			<li><i> 3-6, 8, 10--1: </i> It indicates that it will be stamped on the pages from 3 to 6, on 8 and from 10 to the last page.</li>
