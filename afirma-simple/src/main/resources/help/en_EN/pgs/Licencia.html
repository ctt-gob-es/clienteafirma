 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Are licenses to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
free or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
I want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors&#39; reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
software will automatically obtain licenses, in effect making the
proprietary program.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU General Public License
   CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this general public license.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &quot;modification&quot;).  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately published on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distributing such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third party
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customised for interchange software; or

    (c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    Not applicable for noncommercial distribution
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
any that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under you
this License will not have their terminated licenses so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
The recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues)
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance sheet is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of distributed software
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by either by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add explicit geographical distribution
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguished version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
For the Program, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
Repair or correction.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED)
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    -one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.-
    Copyright (C) -year- name of author-

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show c&#39;; they could even be
mouse clicks or menu ►--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

                             EUPL © European Community 2007 

This Public Licence of the European Union (‘EUPL’) applies to the work or to the work 
computer program (defined below) supplied under the conditions laid down in 
this licence. Any use of the work other than that authorised by the 
is licensed (to the extent that such use is protected by a right of the holder of the 
copyright of the work).

The original work shall be supplied under the conditions laid down in this licence where the 
the licensor (as defined below) has immediately placed the following warning 
after the mention of the copyright of the original work:
 
                        Licence granted under EUPL V.1.1 

or has expressed by another procedure its willingness to grant a licence under 
EUPL. 

  1. Definitions

In this licence, the following definitions apply: 
  - licence: this licence.
  - original work or computer program: distributed computer program 
    or communicated by the licensor under this licence in the form of 
    source code or, where applicable, code executable; 
  - derivative works: the works or the computer programme which the 
    licensee on the basis of the original work or any of the modifications 
    of the Council. This license does not define the degree of modification or dependency 
    from the original work necessary to classify a work as a derivative; said 
    degree to be determined in accordance with copyright law 
    applicable in the country referred to in Article 15;
  - the work: the original work or its derivative works; 
  - source code: the form of the human-readable work that may be 
    more easily studied and modified; 
  - executable code: any code, generally compiled, intended to be 
    executed as a programme by a computer; 
  - licensor: the natural or legal person who distributes or communicates the work with 
    according to the licence; 
  - collaborator: the natural or legal person who modifies the work according to the 
    licence or otherwise contribute to the creation of a derivative work; 
  - licensee:  the natural or legal person making use of any 
    computer programme under the conditions laid down in the licence; 
  - distribution or communication: any act of sale, donation, loan, 
    rental, distribution, communication, transmission or any other act 
    making available, online or offline, copies of the work or access 
    its essential functions to another natural or legal person. 

  2. Scope of rights granted by the Licence 

The licensor grants the licensee a worldwide licence, on a worldwide basis, 
free, non-exclusive and which the licensee can subcontract for as long as they continue 
copyright on the original work and authorises it to: 
  - use the work in any circumstances and for any use; 
  - reproduce the work; 
  - modify the original work and carry out works derived from it; 
  - communicate to the public the work or copies thereof, make available or 
    display the work or copies and, where appropriate, publicly execute the Work; 
  - distribute the work or copies thereof; 
  - to lend and rent the work or copies thereof; 
  - subcontract the rights relating to the work or copies thereof. 

Such rights may be exercised through any means, medium and format, 
known in the present or likely to be invented in the future, to the extent that so 
the applicable law permits. 

In countries whose legislation covers moral rights, the Licensor 
shall waive the exercise thereof to the extent permitted by law; 
in order to give effect to the license of property rights previously 
listed. 

The licensor gives the licensee, free of charge, the rights of use 
exclusive to any patent which it holds, to the extent necessary to ensure that 
the licensee makes use of the rights on the work granted by the present 
licence.

3. Communication of the source code

The licensor may supply the work in the form of a source code or code 
executable. If you provide it in the form of an executable code, you must also provide 
an automatic readable copy of the source code of the work together with each copy 
of the work it distributes, or indicate in a warning inserted after 
the mention of copyright attached to the work, a repository in which 
access the source code easily and free of charge for the period in 
the licensor continues to distribute or communicate the work. 

4. Limitations on copyright

In no case may this licence be interpreted in such a way as to prevent the 
the licensee of the benefits he may enjoy as a result of the 
exceptions or limitations to the exclusive rights of rightholders 
the original work or the computer programme, the termination of such rights or 
any other applicable limitation. 

5. Obligations of the licensee

The transfer of rights under this licence is subject to certain conditions. 
restrictions or obligations to be observed by the licensee. These 
obligations are: 

    Right of allocation: The licensee must keep all the documents in full. 
warnings and mentions to copyright, patents or trademarks, and 
such as those relating to licence and exemption from liability. The 
copies of such warnings and mentions and of the 
License with each copy of the work you distribute or communicate. The licensee is 
shall be responsible for the fact that its modifications or derivative works include a 
A very prominent warning stating that it has modified the work, and the date of 
amendment. 

	Copyleft clause: If the licensee distributes or 
communicate copies of the original work or derivative works based on the work 
the original distribution or communication must be made under the conditions laid down 
in this licence or in a later version of this licence, unless the 
original work is expressly distributed only in this version of the licence. The 
licensee (now as a licensor) will not be able to offer or impose 
additional conditions relating to the work or derivative works which modify or limit 
the conditions of the licence. 

	Compatibility clause: If the licensee distributes or communicates works 
derivatives or copies thereof based in turn on the original work and other work 
licensed under a compatible licence, distribution or communication may 
carried out in accordance with the conditions of that compatible licence. for the purpose of 
this clause shall mean ‘compatible licence’ for any of the licences 
listed in the Appendix to this licence. If any of the above applies to 
the obligations of the licensee under the compatible licence are in collision 
under this licence, the licence obligations shall prevail. 
compatible.

	Supply of the source code: When distributing or communicating copies of the work, the 
licensee must provide a copy of the legible source code automatically or
indicate a repository where the source code can be easily accessed and 
free of charge for the period in which it continues to distribute or communicate the work. 

	Safeguarding other rights: This licence does not permit the use of 
trade names, product or service marks or licensor names, 
except where this is carried out in so far as is reasonable and in accordance with the uses 
as usual, is necessary to indicate the origin of the work and to reproduce the content 
mention of copyright. 

6. Sequence of authorship

The original licensor guarantees to be the original owner of the copyright 
the original work covered by this licence or acquired by means of the 
the relevant licence and be empowered to grant licences for such rights. 

Each collaborator warrants ownership of the copyright on the 
changes it brings to the work or has acquired them by means of the corresponding 
licence and be empowered to grant licences for such rights. 

Each time the licensee accepts the license, the original licensor and the 
later contributors license their own contributions to 
the work under the conditions laid down in this licence. 

7. Exclusion of guarantee

The work is in the process of elaboration, being the subject of continuous improvements 
by a large number of partners. It is not a finished work and therefore can 
contain defects or shortcomings inherent in the development of such programmes. 

For this reason, the work, under the licence, is supplied ‘as is’, without 
guarantees of any kind, in particular in a non-exhaustive list, as long as 
marketing, suitability for a given purpose, absence of defects 
or errors, accuracy and non-infringement of intellectual property rights 
other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Directive 
licence. 

This exclusion of warranty forms an essential part of the licence and is a condition for 
assignment of any right in respect of the work.

8. Exclusion of liability

Except in cases of dolo or damage caused directly to natural persons, the 
Licensee shall not be liable for damages of any kind, direct 
or indirect, material or moral, which may arise from the licence or use of 
the work, in particular, in a non-exhaustive list of damages 
for loss of good reputation, technical failure, failure or malfunction of 
computer equipment, data loss or any commercial damage, even if the 
He was aware of the possibility of such damage. However, the licensor shall 
in accordance with the legal rules governing liability for 
damage caused by products, insofar as those rules are applicable 
at work. 

9. Additional agreements

When distributing the original work or derivative works, the licensee may subscribe to a 
additional agreement, and charge remuneration to provide assistance and provide 
guarantees or to take compensation or other liability or liability obligations
provide services compatible with this licence. However, in accepting such
obligations, the licensee shall act solely in his own name and under his exclusive
liability and never on behalf of the original licensor or any other contributor,
and this provided that it agrees to indemnify, defend and defend any collaborator on the front lines
any liability which the latter may incur and in the face of any claims 
may be brought against him because the licensee has accepted the said guarantee; or
additional liability. 

10. Acceptance of the licence

The provisions of this license can be accepted by clicking the icon 
‘OK’ located at the bottom of the window where the text of the 
present a licence or by expressing the consent of any other similar form, 
in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. By clicking on said 
icon, the unequivocal and irrevocable acceptance of this licence and of 
all its content.  

The licensee also irrevocably accepts this licence and all its licensors. 
conditions merely by exercising any of the rights conferred on it by the 
Article 2 of this licence, such as the use of the work, the creation of a 
the distribution or communication of the work or copies thereof. 

11. Information to the public

Where the licensee proceeds to the distribution or communication of the work 
by electronic means (e.g. offering the download of the work at a distance), 
the distribution channel(s) (e.g. a website) must provide 
at least the information required by applicable law concerning the 
the licence and the manner in which the licensee can access such licence; 
data, accept, retain and reproduce them. 

12. Termination of the licence

The licence and the rights granted under it shall be automatically extinguished if 
the licensee fails to comply with any of the conditions of the licence. 

However, such an extinction will not entail the licensing of the 
persons who have received the work of the licensee under the licence, always 
that such persons continue to comply fully with the conditions of the licence. 

13. Miscellaneous

By way of derogation from Article 9, the licence shall represent the whole of the 
agreement between the parties as to the work to which it relates. 

The possible invalidity or ineffectiveness of any provision of this licence under 
in accordance with the legislation in force shall not affect the overall validity or effectiveness of the 
licence. In such cases, the provision shall be interpreted or reformulated as appropriate. 
to make it valid and effective. 

The European Commission may publish other language versions or new versions. 
this licence to the extent necessary and reasonable and without reducing 
the scope of the rights granted by the licence. The new versions of the 
the licence shall be published with a single version number.  All Lingü versions
of this licence approved by the European Commission are of equal value. The Marketing Authorisation Holder

14. Competent courts

Disputes relating to the interpretation of this licence between 
the European Commission, acting as a licensor, and a licensee, shall submit to the 
the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, under the 
Article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. 

Disputes relating to the interpretation of this licence between 
parties other than the European Commission shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
court which is competent in the place where he resides or pursues his principal activity 
the licensor. 

15. Applicable law

This Licence shall be governed by the laws of the Member State of the European Union. 
the licensor resides or has his registered office. 

This licence shall be governed by Belgian law if: 
  - a dispute arises between the European Commission, as a licensor, and 
    a licensee;
